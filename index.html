                                There are two nearly identical drink machines in the Met that stand on opposite sides of the "drink" corner of the Met. The corner has a stack of clean, empty cups on the left side.<br>
                                The Maine Root drink machines dispense cubed ice and a variety of soft drinks such as cola, diet cola, ginger ale, and lemonade. The dispensers work by pressing a cup against a vertical, plastic bar which will dispense the corresponding substance for the duration that the bar is pushed. The ice is dispensed in a similar way but with a wider, square bar to press into.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem this interface is solving is the issue of allowing users complete control over their soft drink. The goal of this machine is to allow users to easily select and dispense their drink without hassle.

                                Leisurely Larry does not face a lot of problems with this interface. They are perhaps somewhat frustrated by the machine not working, but they have the spirit of moving on and getting a drink anyways. This makes them a fairly good persona, since most drink machine users are frequent users like this who know how to reach their goals even if a few small things go wrong.

                                Nervous Nelly represents a user base who are less familiar with these particular machines and their quirks. Being less familiar with the space, they may be a little more frustrated when things go wrong. However, we see in Nelly's user journey that avoiding confrontation by going with the flow is what will likely happen if this user encounters any issues. This makes sense since we hardly see users who are genuinely causing a scene.
